# ChatBotNLTK

This is a simple Self-learning(Retrieval-based) Chat Bot developed using NLTK. It uses a sample dialog dataset to answer any questions using cosine similarity with other questions. 

In retrieval-based models, a chatbot uses some heuristic to select a response from a library of predefined responses. The chatbot uses the message and context of the conversation for selecting the best response from a predefined list of bot messages.
